## **Getting a good REFERENCE**

- Ensure every component is placed correctly
- Avoid using PCBA with contamination. Clean the PCBA before taking the picture
- Avoid mixing different components with same specifications. The software is not able to "read" the labeling and will mark them even if they have the same specifications. If a component have changed during production make a new REFERENCE image to avoid false positive marking.
- Avoid taking images with cables or components with high position variability. This would result in a high false positive rate in the marking.
- Ensure the image has been taken correctly focused and all components looks sharp. If not, repeat the capture.
