We recommend uploading photos of 12 Megapixels. The better the photo, the better the results.

If you do not have a camera of sufficient quality, we can email you some PCBA photos taken withour inspecƟon plaƞorm. 

During this trial stage, we will be monitoring the results. We will email you with comments about
how to improve the detection capacities of the soŌware. Keep in mind that they will be heavily influenced by the quality of the photos taken. All the images uploaded to AgnosPCB will be removed from the server within 24h.
