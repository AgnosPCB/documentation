    For optimal results, we advise uploading photos with a resolution of 12 Megapixels. The quality of the photo directly influences the accuracy of the inspection results. In the event that you do not possess a camera of sufficient quality, we can provide you with PCBA photos captured using our inspection platform.

Throughout the trial period, our team will monitor the results and provide feedback on how to enhance the detection capabilities of the software. It's important to note that the quality of the photos significantly impacts the results. Rest assured, all images uploaded to AgnosPCB will be promptly removed from our servers within 24 hours.
