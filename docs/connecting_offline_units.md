The **SONY camera** uses a battery DUMMY, so it can be ON for unlimited time. That battery dummy needs a 5V and 3A power supply (provided with the KIT as a separate unit or integrated in the power strip). At the same time, the camera will be controlled from the computer, so use the provided high-speed 2m USB-micro USB cable to connect the camera to your **INTEL NUC**.

To install and configure the camera go to following section: [How to connect the camera](Connect-the-camera.md "How to connect the camera")
