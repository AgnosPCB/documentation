# Set exclusion area

The exclusion area is used to analyze the **PCB** by excluding certain items that are not necessary or not wanted to be analyzed. For this we use the button **¨draw exclusion area¨.**

Then, using the **REFERENCE** photo, select the area to be excluded. You can select as many areas as you want.

Now, examining the **UUI** will not detect any errors in the selected areas.

In case you have selected the wrong area or you do not want to select it anymore, you can use the **¨remove area¨** button to deselect it.

Likewise, the number of selected exclusion areas is displayed when the report is **generated.**
