??? info "¿How do I update the software for my Raspberry 400?"

    Get to this page and follow instructions: how to update/ restore the Agnospcb OS (Raspberry 400 system)

??? info "I am getting “time-out” errors when inspecting my circuits. How do I solve it?"

    The Agnospcb inspection software needs a fast and reliable internet connection, as some areas of the photos taken will be sent to our neural network server. That means that, an internet wired connection or Fiber internet service (100-1000Mbps) is mandatory. Otherwise, the software will take over 10 seconds to process one inspection and the “time-out” error message will appear. If you need an “off-line” solution, contact us.

??? info "The camera does not respond"

    Check if the battery dummy is connected to the correct USB power supply, capable of delivering 3A. Check if the USB cable is properly connected and fully inserted. Does the R a S keys of the keyboard trigger the camera?

??? info "I am using a 4K monitor and the system is performing slowly."

    The Raspberry 400 OS and Inspection software has been optimized to run smoothly with FULL-HD monitors (1080p). 4K monitor will decrease the overall performance of the system.

??? info "I can not log in with my credentials"

    If you are getting an “Unknown Error” or “Login Error” message, check if your internet connection is running in the background a firewall or if it has been capped. A quick way to narrow down the problem would be creating a mobile hotspot and connect the Raspberry 400 to it. Contact us if the issue persists.
