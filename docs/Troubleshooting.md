??? info "I am getting “time-out” errors when inspecting my circuits. How do I solve it?"

    The Agnospcb inspection software needs a fast and reliable internet connection, as some areas of the photos taken will be sent to our neural network server. That means that, an internet wired connection or Fiber internet service (100-1000Mbps) is mandatory. Otherwise, the software will take over 10 seconds to process one inspection and the “time-out” error message will appear. If you need an “off-line” solution, contact us.

??? info "The camera does not respond"

    Check if the battery dummy is connected to the correct USB power supply, capable of delivering 3A. Check if the USB cable is properly connected and fully inserted. Does the R a S keys of the keyboard trigger the camera?
