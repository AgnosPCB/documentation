 Then, carefully tighten the screws to secure the lights in place, ensuring they are properly aligned. After securing the lights, pass the cable **under the platform** to ensure a tidy setup. Repeat this procedure on both sides of the platform for uniform illumination. 

## **How to install the mast**

Next, once the LED lights are in place, move on to assembling the camera mast. To do this, join the two parts of the mast as shown in the picture and place a cover on both edges.
