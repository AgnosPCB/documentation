The **SONY camera** will use a battery DUMMY, so it can be ON for unlimited time. That battery dummy needs a 5V and 3A power supply (provided with the **KIT** as a separate unit or integrated in the power strip). At the same time, the camera will be controlled from the computer, so use the provided High-speed 2m USB-micro USB cable to connect the camera to any free **USB port.**
