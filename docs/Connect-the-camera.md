???+ warning "important"

    All the PCB to be inspected have to be perfectly leveled. If the panel/circuit has a certain tilt angle, not all the elements shapes will be perfectly defined limiting the software recognition capacities.

To capture the whole dimension of the panel / circuit you are inspected, move the camera UP in the mast. For smaller circuits/ panel, move it down but **never use digital zoom**.

???+ warning "important"

    Do not use the DIGITAL ZOOM with the 50mm optics system. It will only artificially increase the size of the digital image not adding real info to the photograph.

If you change any parameter or adjust the camera while the system is ON, the camera will get unresponsive. You will need to disconnect it from the laptop and reconnect it again.
