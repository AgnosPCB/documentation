# **UUI to REFERENCE**
___

When inspecting a **PCB**, if you discover that a **UUI** image is more suitable as a reference than the current one, you have the option to convert it into a reference image with a **single button click**

![UUI to REFERENCE button](../assets/UUI-to-REF.png){ align=right }

For example, in this image we have a **UUI**

![UUI photo](../assets/UUI.png)

And now, after pressing the button **¨UUI to REFERENCE¨** now the same PCB is being used as **REFERENCE**
